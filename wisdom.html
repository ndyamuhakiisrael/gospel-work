<h1>Qualities of a wise person</h1>
<body><p>Cultivated</p>
    <ul>In learning to know other things and other minds, we become more intimately acquainted with ourselves and are to ourselves better worth knowing</ul>
    <p>Good listeners</p>
    <ul>Good listeners have a huge advantage. For one, when they engage in conversation, they make people 'feel' heard. They 'feel' that someone really understands their wants, needs, and desires. And for good reason; a good listener does care to understand</ul>
    <p>Nonconformists</p>
    <ul>Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing, you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”</ul>
    <p>Open-minded</p>
    <ul>Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in.”</ul>
    <p>Problem-centered</p>
    <ul>Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women's empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all</ul>
    <p>Reflective</p>
    <ul>Take time out to reflect on yourself. Do you like what you see? Do you wish to change some attitudes, traits, and habits? Remember, it is never too late to change</ul>
    <p> Humorful</p>
    <ul>A keen sense of humor helps us to overlook the unbecoming, understand the unconventional, tolerated the unpleasant, overcome the unexpected, and outlast the unbearable</ul>
    <p>Unselfish</p>
    <ul>Happiness is spiritual, born of truth and love. It is unselfish; therefore it cannot exist alone but requires all mankind to share it.</ul>
    <p>Willing</p>
    <ul>There are many persons ready to do what is right because in their hearts they know it is right. But they hesitate, waiting for the other fellow to make the make the first move - and he, in turn, waits for you</ul>
